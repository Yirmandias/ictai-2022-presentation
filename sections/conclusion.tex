    OMPAS
    \begin{itemize}
        \item New implementation of RAE.
        \item Extension for a native support of concurrency and resource management.
        \item Dedicated acting language suitable for automated analysis.
    \end{itemize}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Perspectives}
    Use planning as a continuous process to guide the acting system decisions.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Extend the automated analysis of SOMPAS models \cite{turiGuidanceRefinementbasedActing2022} for concurrency and resource primitives.
    \item Extend the use of the planner to arbitrary and resource acquisition.
    \end{itemize}

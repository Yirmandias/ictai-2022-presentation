\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}[c]{Conclusion}
    OMPAS, an extension of RAE with
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Native support for concurrency and resource management.
        \item Acting language suitable for automated analysis.
    \end{itemize}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Perspectives}
    Use planning as a continuous process to guide the acting system decisions by
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Extending the automated analysis of SOMPAS models \cite{turiGuidanceRefinementbasedActing2022} for concurrency and resource primitives.
    \item Extending the use of the planner to arbitrary and resource acquisition.
    \end{itemize}
